# Simple Preact App with Github API
Basic packages:
* *webpack* - generates the `bundle.js` that will be run in the browser from the source files.
* *webpack-dev-server* - lightweight development server, regenerates the bundle (incrementally) when files change, so the file isn't written to disk again on each change.
* *babel-core* - transforms JS features for browser compatibility.
* *babel-loader* - get webpack and babel talking.
* *babel-preset-env* - gets the right features for the different browsers.
* *babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx* - transforms jsx to browser js.

## Adding the initial dependencies
```bash
yard add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx
